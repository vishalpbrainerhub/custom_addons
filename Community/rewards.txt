we talked to the customer, this is what he would like for Reward program management

More than one point for every euro spent, we would like to channel sales towards some products in particular; e.g.
we have 3000 products in the catalogue, well, only 300 products we would like to be entitled to receive points, to be quantified product by product,
or if we can't even just based on the value. Let me know if I wasn't clear.

the customer would like to assign a score manually, which is different for each individual product
in the end or 300 or 3000 products at the development level does not change, create a field to enter the score
therefore we will also have products with a zero score
logically on the frontend of the app when the product has a zero score, the zero value should not be seen.
The score will only be visible if it is greater than 0
we are deciding now what the logic will be for taking the prizes from the catalogue



we also defined the prize catalogue.
customers can accumulate points and use them at their discretion to obtain rewards.
 Ex: they have accumulated 100 points they can redeem
a 50 point prize and he has 50 points left.
Or he can take two products from the catalog each worth 50 points.
